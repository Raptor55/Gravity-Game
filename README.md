# Gravity-Game
Gravity Game is a simple rotation based Android game that a friend and I made at the February 2015 Codeday.
Right now the game is still in a very rudimentary state, as the only features implemented are the axis rotation sensing, 
collision, and movement. In the game, the character is a circle that always moves down relative to the earth in real life. 
The game is played by turning the phone in order to make the circle avoid obstacles and reaching the finish line. Because of the way the accelerometers in android phones work, in order to play the game optimally, your phone should always be held perpendicular to the ground when rotating it to play this game!
